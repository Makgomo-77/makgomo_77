## 👤 About Me

I am a learner of the ALX Front-end/ProDev Backend programs,and I'm  currently revamping my Github profile to reflect my growth,skills, and career goals.with a background in BSC in Mathematical And Computer Science,which has given me a solid foundation in logical problem-solving, programming , and analytical thinking.

I'm passionate about software engineering because I believe in buliding solutions that are both visually engaging and functionally robust.What inspires me is the power of technology to solve real-world problems,simplify lives ,and create opportunities.

My aim is to become a wel-rounded full-stack developer who delivers impactful and user-centered digital products.I'm especially interested in working on:
-Responsive  and animated web applications
_Booking and listing  platforms
_Full-stack portfolio and personal branding tools
_Backend systems like REST APIs and authentication platforms
